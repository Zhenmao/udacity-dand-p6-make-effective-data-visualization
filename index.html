    <h2>Best Months for Air Travel</h2>
    <div>
    <p>Air travel delays and cancellations can range from being inconvenient to being a catastrophe that ruins the travel plan. </p>
    <p>The bubble chart shows the percentages of departure delays (x axis), arrival delays (y axis) and cancellation (bubble area) of each month of 2008 for US air travels.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> </br>The bar charts show the ranking of months according to the percentages. </br>Colors represnt the four seasons: <span class="season-spring">spring</span>, <span class="season-summer">summer</span>, <span class="season-fall">fall</span>, <span class="season-winter">winter</span>.</p>
    <p>We can clearly see that <span class="season-fall">fall</span> months are great time for air travel. On the other hand, <span class="season-winter">winter</span> has some of the worst months, especially during December the holidy season.</p>
